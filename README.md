# Falcon 9 Reusability Prediction

This project, a part of an Applied Data Science course, aims to predict the reuse rate of SpaceX's Falcon 9 first stage using machine learning models. By analyzing the provided dataset, we'll develop and compare models like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and SVM. Join us in exploring the economics of space travel and enhancing predictive analytics in aerospace engineering.

**Key Objectives:**
- Predict Falcon 9 first stage reuse rate.
- Utilize Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and SVM.
- Hyperparameter tuning using Grid Search.

Feel free to explore the code, data, and documentation. Contributions and feedback are welcome.

# Falcon 9 Reusability Prediction

Welcome to the **Falcon 9 Reusability Prediction** project! This initiative is part of our Applied Data Science course and centers on forecasting the reusability rate of SpaceX's Falcon 9 first stage through machine learning models. We'll delve into the dataset, employing various techniques, including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and SVM, to provide insights into the economics of space travel and bolster predictive analytics in the field of aerospace engineering.

## Project Objectives

1. **Forecast Falcon 9 First Stage Reusability**: Our primary aim is to predict the reuse rate of the Falcon 9 first stage, contributing to the understanding of space travel economics.

2. **Diverse Machine Learning Models**: We will explore the performance of multiple machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and SVM to find the most accurate prediction.

3. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: To optimize model performance, we'll use Grid Search to fine-tune hyperparameters.

## Getting Involved

Feel free to navigate through our code, datasets, and documentation. I greatly appreciate contributions and feedback from the community.
